```

If we print the `mix` variable in every loop:

```python
for step in steps: 
    mix = step(mix, ranDOCm(step))
    print(mix)
return mix
```

There is a hint printed:

```python
from recipe import *; print("flag =  " + get_FLAG_from_HEX(hex))
```

So we just execute it, and get the flag: `brunner{7Urn5_0uT_th3Re_WasN7_4nY_SEcr3T5_4FtR_A1l_x)_Badum-tss}`
