-1.689	"The rain lashed against your trench coat, each drop a tiny, cold accusation. Another missing person case, another dead end, another miserable Tuesday. Detective Miles Corbin, that's you, and your current lead (a cryptic, water-damaged note found in a pigeon's nest – don't ask) has brought you to the edge of the infamous Ravenwood Woods. Locals whispered tales of strange lights and even stranger disappearances. 'Probably just a particularly aggressive badger,' you'd muttered to yourself, but the unease in your gut told a different story. The path, if you could even call it that, dissolved into a muddy, overgrown track. Ahead, barely visible through the downpour, a faint flicker of light. A cabin. Wooden, dilapidated, and looking like it had swallowed more than a few secrets. 'Well, Miles,' you sighed, 'you've certainly seen worse invitations to tetanus.' You push open the creaky wooden door. The smell of damp earth and something vaguely metallic, like old pennies, fills your nostrils. As you step inside, a sudden, heavy THUD echoes behind you. The door slams shut. You try the handle. Locked. And no amount of jiggling, rattling, or polite pleading seems to make a difference. "You are in a dimly lit, rectangular room. The air is thick with the scent of damp wood and something undefinable, perhaps just the lingering dread of forgotten lives. Rain streaks down the single, grimy window on the far wall. A crude wooden table, two rickety chairs, and a dusty, moth-eaten rug are the only furniture. A small, unlit fireplace sits against one wall, its hearth filled with cold ashes. On the table, a flickering oil lamp casts dancing shadows. Next to the lamp lays a notebook with the following text scribbles on it: flag{bd96db352436ef4f8ec6cada5979b038}."
