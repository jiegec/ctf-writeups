#  Can you hEAR me?

```
A satellite has fallen from orbit, and miraculously, it is still operational. It appears to be running on a RAD-EAR-3 CPU, which is known for its reliability in space applications. The satellite has a handful of program cartridges that it can swap between (like a jukebox), and one of them is labeled "hello". Can you figure out how to run it? We need the satellite's serial number!
```

Run the peg file using `runpeg` directly:

```shell
$ ./runpeg CanYouHearMe.peg
RAD-EAR-3 CPU initialized, running at 10MHz

Board serial number: sun{d0_n0t_fEAR_th1s_c4t3g0ry}
```

Flag: `sun{d0_n0t_fEAR_th1s_c4t3g0ry}`.
