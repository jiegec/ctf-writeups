# BigMak

```
I tried typing out the flag for you, but our Astronaut Coleson seems to have changed the terminal's keyboard layout? He went out to get a big mak so I guess we're screwed. Whatever, here's the flag, if you can somehow get it back to normal.

rlk{blpdfp_iajylg_iyi}
```

The name `BigMak` is similar to [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak), so the flag is QWERTY typed into Colemak. So we just find the mapping for each character:

```
rlk{blpdfp_iajylg_iyi}
->
sun{burger_layout_lol}
```

Flag: `sun{burger_layout_lol}`.
