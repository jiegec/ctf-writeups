# Tribble with my Skin

```
My Minecraft account got hacked and now my skin seems to be a little off...

Might be having trouble with the tribbles...

Mind checking it out? My Minecraft username is "oatzs".

PS: A Minecraft account/instance is not required for this challenge. The most recently used skin is the suspicious one.

Search for `oatzs` online leads to <https://namemc.com/profile/oatzs.2>, find the latest skin at <https://namemc.com/skin/4ee8b166aa874c73>, download the skin as image:
