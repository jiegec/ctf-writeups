TL;DR;

    Play Fair: Do not attack the infrastructure (no automatic tools!), other teams, or cause any harm beyond the boundaries of the CTF challenges. When in doubt, ask!
    Teams: You can participate solo or in teams. Teamwork is not mandatory (but highly suggested). Please note that the registration is for TEAMS only (so if you're alone, you are considered as a solo-team).
    No Flag Sharing: Each team must solve the challenges themselves. Do not share flags or solutions with other teams or individuals. Any collaboration between teams is prohibited and will be punished with an (unappealable) ban.
    Flag format is snakeCTF{GLHF}
    Respect Time Limits: The CTF runs from start time to end time. No late submissions will be accepted once the competition ends.
    Communication: Use only the official channels for discussing CTF-related matters. Use only the english language to communicate on public channels. If you need to reach the admins, please open a ticket on Discord.
    Harassment policy: Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. We are committed to inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment. Reporting procedures can be found here.
    Prizes: SnakeCTF has a total prize pool of 1792 Euros. Prizes will be awarded during the SnakeCTF Finals, to the top ranked teams of the SnakeCTF Finals. Participating solely to the SnakeCTF Quals will not award any prizes.
    Have fun and learn: Remember, this CTF is designed for learning and growing your skills.
