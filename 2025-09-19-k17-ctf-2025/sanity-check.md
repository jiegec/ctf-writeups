RulesðŸš©

    No flag sharing or helping other teams in any unfair way. This will result in immediate disqualification from the event.
    No attacking the infrastructure in any way. This includes brute-forcing flags or challenges. For example, please do not use scanning tools such as DirBuster or SQLmap.
    The scope of what you're allowed to attack are all the domains that match *.k17.kctf.cloud and *.k17.secso.cc.
    No "flag hoarding" or dumping flags at last minute, submit the work when you solve it.
    Choose the correct team division as per the prizes page.
    All flags have the regex /^K17{.*}$/, unless otherwise specified. For example, the sanity check flag is K17{we_hop3_y0u_h@ve_Fun}.
    Do NOT post fake flags.
    Any decisions made by K17 CTF organisers is final.
    Important: HAVE FUN!!!
```

Flag: `K17{we_hop3_y0u_h@ve_Fun}`.
